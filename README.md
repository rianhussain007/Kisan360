# Kisan360: The AI Smart Farming Assistant

> **Hackathon Submission**  
> This project is a submission for **VYUHATECH 2.0 National Level Hackathon**

## üå± Empowering India's Farmers with Data-Driven Insights

## Problem Statement
Indian smallholder farmers face significant challenges due to climate change, pest infestations, and market volatility. These factors lead to unpredictable crop yields, financial instability, and reduced agricultural productivity. Farmers often lack access to timely, localized information that could help them make better farming decisions.

## Our Solution
Kisan360 is a mobile-first web application that leverages artificial intelligence and real-time data to provide hyper-personalized farming advice. By integrating weather forecasts, soil conditions, market prices, and computer vision, we deliver actionable insights directly to farmers' smartphones in their local language.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üìç Hyper-Local Advisory**  
  Get personalized farming recommendations based on your exact GPS location, soil type, and crop selection.

- **üå¶Ô∏è Live Weather & Alerts**  
  Real-time weather updates and early warnings for extreme conditions like droughts, heavy rain, or temperature fluctuations.

- **üì∏ AI Crop Scanner**  
  Simply take a photo of a plant leaf to instantly detect potential diseases and pest infestations.

- **üìà Market Price Tracking**  
  Access real-time price data from nearby agricultural markets (mandis) to sell your produce at the best possible price.
